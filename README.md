# UKODUS

Presented here are ten solved sudoku puzzles. Your goal is to take the problems and remove as many numbers from the puzzles
as possible while still keeping them as a valid Sudoku puzzle (it must have a unique solution).

## Rules

Your score will be the total number of numbers that you are able to remove from the 10 puzzles listed below. The highest score
will be the winner.

You will be required to submit:
- Your 10 uncompleted puzzles
- Your declared score

Deadline is 3:00 PM PDT. We'll take a quick break to collate results, and then do ~10 minute presentations from each team on
their process and solutions. The winners will be the team that is able to remove the largest amount of numbers from the given
puzzles. In case of a tie, the team that submits their results first will be the winner.


Each proposed solution will be validated. An invalid solution (e.g. unsolveable due to lack of uniqueness) will score 0 for that particular puzzle.

You are expected to not rely on automated solvers (which have been written prior to starting this task, by you or anyone else)
to develop your solutions, Similarly, you're expected to not search for algorithms directly related to the problem at hand aside
from using the whitelisted resources listed a the bottom.
